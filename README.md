# DialogTool

A browser-based dialog editor using React Flow. It loads dialog data from `data/dialog.json` and allows you to visually edit nodes and choices. Select a node to edit speaker, text, and choices in the sidebar. Add new nodes or download the dialog as JSON.

Open `index.html` in a browser to start editing.
